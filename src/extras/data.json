    "output": "Meander is a verb used to describe the act of following a winding or indirect course. It refers to a lazy or leisurely movement that involves wandering aimlessly, often without any set destination or direction in mind. Meander can also refer to a curve, bend, or winding loop in a river or stream, as these bodies of water often follow a meandering path. The term can also be used figuratively to describe a conversation or train of thought that drifts from topic to topic without any clear purpose or direction."
